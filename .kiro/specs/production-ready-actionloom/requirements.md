# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements to transform ActionLoom from a prototype into a fully functioning production application. ActionLoom is a visual blockchain workflow builder for the Flow ecosystem that enables users to create, execute, and manage blockchain automations without coding. To become production-ready, the application needs user management, data persistence, security hardening, performance optimization, and robust infrastructure.

5. WHEN user data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection regulations
6. WHEN security audits are performed THEN the system SHALL pass comprehensive security assessments

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be fast and responsive so that I can build workflows efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL display content within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN blockchain data is fetched THEN the system SHALL cache results to reduce API calls
3. WHEN workflows are executed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates
4. WHEN the application is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain responsiveness through proper caching
5. WHEN images and assets load THEN the system SHALL optimize them for fast delivery
6. WHEN database queries run THEN the system SHALL execute them efficiently with proper indexing

### Requirement 7: Workflow Templates and Marketplace

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to pre-built workflow templates so that I can quickly start with common blockchain automation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses templates THEN the system SHALL display categorized workflow templates
