# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ActionLoom is experiencing critical runtime errors that prevent the application from functioning properly. These errors include missing React imports, missing API route files, and build failures that need immediate resolution to restore application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to load without runtime errors, so that I can use the workflow builder interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL not throw "useMemo is not defined" errors
2. WHEN React components are rendered THEN the system SHALL have all necessary React hooks imported
3. WHEN the workflow canvas loads THEN the system SHALL display the interface without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the API endpoints to be accessible, so that the application can fetch actions and function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes a request to /api/actions THEN the system SHALL return a valid response
2. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL not return 404 or 500 errors
3. WHEN the actions library loads THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch available actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that the application can be deployed and run in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without missing file errors
2. WHEN Next.js builds the application THEN the system SHALL generate all required route files
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL serve all necessary static assets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the interface even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior
3. WHEN components fail to load THEN the system SHALL not crash the entire application
