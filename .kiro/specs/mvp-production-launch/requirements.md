# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the minimum viable product (MVP) requirements to launch ActionLoom as a production-ready platform for Flow blockchain users. The focus is on core functionality that enables users to create, save, and execute workflows reliably while building a foundation for future features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Wallet Integration

**User Story:** As a Flow blockchain user, I want to authenticate with my Flow wallet so that I can save my workflows and execute them on-chain securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits ActionLoom THEN the system SHALL provide a "Connect Wallet" option
2. WHEN a user connects their Flow wallet THEN the system SHALL authenticate using FCL wallet signature verification
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their wallet address and connection status
4. WHEN a user disconnects their wallet THEN the system SHALL clear their session and return to guest mode
5. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow building workflows but disable saving and execution
6. WHEN wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2: Workflow Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to save and manage my workflows so that I can reuse them and build a library of automations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide a "Save Workflow" button
2. WHEN a user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL store it with a name, description, and timestamp
3. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all their saved workflows
4. WHEN a user clicks on a saved workflow THEN the system SHALL load it into the builder
5. WHEN a user deletes a workflow THEN the system SHALL remove it after confirmation
6. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show a message encouraging wallet connection to save workflows

### Requirement 3: Production Database and Data Layer

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data storage so that user workflows are persisted securely and can be retrieved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use proper database schemas and indexing
3. WHEN workflows are saved THEN the system SHALL store complete workflow data including nodes, edges, and parameters
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and inform users
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through connection pooling
6. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds under normal conditions

### Requirement 4: Real Flow Blockchain Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute my workflows on the actual Flow blockchain so that I can perform real transactions and operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes a workflow THEN the system SHALL generate valid Cadence transactions
2. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN the system SHALL use the connected wallet for signing
3. WHEN transactions are executed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates
4. WHEN transactions complete THEN the system SHALL display transaction results and blockchain links
5. WHEN transactions fail THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages and suggested fixes
6. WHEN users switch networks THEN the system SHALL support both Flow testnet and mainnet

### Requirement 5: User Dashboard and Workflow Library

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dashboard to manage my workflows so that I can organize and access my blockchain automations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user visits the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their workflow library
2. WHEN workflows are displayed THEN the system SHALL show name, description, creation date, and last modified
3. WHEN a user searches workflows THEN the system SHALL filter results by name and description
4. WHEN a user creates a new workflow THEN the system SHALL provide a "New Workflow" button
5. WHEN workflows are listed THEN the system SHALL support sorting by date and name
6. WHEN a user has no workflows THEN the system SHALL show helpful getting started guidance

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Security and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure and reliable workflow execution so that I can trust the platform with my blockchain transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users input parameters THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs before execution
2. WHEN high-value transactions are detected THEN the system SHALL show additional confirmation dialogs
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them and display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the system detects suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL require additional confirmation
5. WHEN users interact with the platform THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
6. WHEN transactions are simulated THEN the system SHALL show estimated gas costs and effects

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive interactions so that I can build workflows efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL display content within 3 seconds
2. WHEN blockchain data is fetched THEN the system SHALL cache results to improve performance
3. WHEN workflows are loaded THEN the system SHALL restore them quickly from the database
4. WHEN the canvas is used THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interactions even with complex workflows
5. WHEN images and assets load THEN the system SHALL optimize them for fast delivery
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading states and error handling

### Requirement 8: Production Deployment Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application deployed on reliable infrastructure so that users can access it consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run on containerized infrastructure
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent users without performance degradation
3. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL use zero-downtime deployment strategies
4. WHEN the system is monitored THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and basic monitoring
5. WHEN errors occur in production THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging
6. WHEN the database needs backup THEN the system SHALL have automated backup procedures

### Requirement 9: Basic Analytics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic analytics and monitoring so that I can understand system health and user engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the platform THEN the system SHALL track basic usage metrics
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture error information for debugging
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
4. WHEN workflows are executed THEN the system SHALL track execution success rates
5. WHEN users sign up THEN the system SHALL track user registration and retention metrics
6. WHEN reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide basic dashboard metrics

### Requirement 10: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to access ActionLoom on my mobile device so that I can view and manage my workflows on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface
2. WHEN users navigate on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly interactions
3. WHEN workflows are viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
4. WHEN the workflow builder is used on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide basic editing capabilities
5. WHEN users execute workflows on mobile THEN the system SHALL support wallet connections
6. WHEN mobile performance is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable loading times
