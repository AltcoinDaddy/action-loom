# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for integrating ActionLoom with Flow's Forte upgrade features, specifically the dynamic Action discovery system and Agent-based automation capabilities. The current ActionLoom implementation provides a solid visual workflow builder foundation, but needs to be enhanced to leverage Forte's standardized Actions and Agents for true blockchain automation.

The Forte upgrade introduces two key concepts:
1. **Actions**: Standardized, metadata-rich interfaces for blockchain operations
2. **Agents**: On-chain schedulers for automated workflow execution

This integration will transform ActionLoom from a static workflow builder into a dynamic, AI-ready automation platform that can discover and compose real blockchain Actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Action Discovery System

**User Story:** As a developer or AI agent, I want ActionLoom to automatically discover available Actions from Flow's on-chain registries, so that I can compose workflows using real, up-to-date blockchain operations instead of hardcoded mock actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL query Flow's Access API to discover available Actions from on-chain registries
2. WHEN Action metadata is retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache the results in Redis with TTL for performance optimization
3. WHEN Actions are discovered THEN the system SHALL parse and validate metadata including inputs, outputs, parameters, and compatibility requirements
4. WHEN a user searches for Actions THEN the system SHALL provide semantic search capabilities using keyword matching or vector embeddings
5. WHEN Action metadata changes on-chain THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the cached data
6. WHEN Actions are incompatible THEN the system SHALL flag compatibility issues during workflow composition

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Natural Language Processing

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want to describe complex workflows in natural language like "Swap 100 USDC to FLOW, stake in PoolX, mint an NFT", so that I can create blockchain automations without understanding technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs natural language THEN the system SHALL parse the text using NLP to extract intent and parameters
2. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL output structured JSON with identified Actions and parameters
3. WHEN ambiguous inputs are detected THEN the system SHALL request clarification from the user
4. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions and examples
5. WHEN Actions are identified THEN the system SHALL validate parameter types and ranges
6. WHEN the workflow is parsed THEN the system SHALL display real-time feedback showing recognized Actions and parameters

### Requirement 3: Advanced Workflow Validation and Simulation

**User Story:** As a workflow creator, I want the system to validate my workflow chains and simulate execution before deployment, so that I can catch errors like incompatible types or insufficient funds before spending gas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is composed THEN the system SHALL validate Action compatibility by checking input/output type matching
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL use Flow emulator to simulate the entire workflow off-chain
3. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL report gas estimates, balance requirements, and potential outcomes
4. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested fixes
5. WHEN resource safety is checked THEN the system SHALL ensure no dangling resources or memory leaks in generated Cadence
6. WHEN complex workflows are validated THEN the system SHALL handle chains with 10+ Actions efficiently

### Requirement 4: Agent-Based Automation System

**User Story:** As a user wanting recurring automation, I want to deploy my workflows as Agents that can execute on schedules or in response to events, so that I can automate complex DeFi strategies without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses automation THEN the system SHALL generate Cadence code for Agent deployment with scheduling logic
2. WHEN scheduling is configured THEN the system SHALL support recurring schedules (daily, weekly, monthly) and event triggers
3. WHEN event triggers are set THEN the system SHALL integrate with oracle Actions for price feeds and other external data
4. WHEN Agents are deployed THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and management capabilities
5. WHEN Agent execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide error reporting and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN Agents are active THEN the system SHALL maintain 99% uptime for scheduled executions

### Requirement 5: AI Agent API Integration

**User Story:** As an AI system or trading bot, I want programmatic APIs to compose and execute workflows, so that I can integrate ActionLoom's capabilities into automated trading and DeFi strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agents make API calls THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints for workflow composition (/api/compose)
2. WHEN workflows are submitted via API THEN the system SHALL accept JSON payloads with Action steps and parameters
3. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL return generated Cadence code or transaction IDs
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL implement secure API key management
5. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling for API endpoints
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error responses with actionable information

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Security and Auditing

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want ActionLoom to generate secure, audited Cadence code and protect against common vulnerabilities, so that I can trust the platform with valuable assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Cadence code is generated THEN the system SHALL follow Flow's security best practices and patterns
2. WHEN user inputs are processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN workflows are complex THEN the system SHALL audit generated code using Flow's analysis tools
4. WHEN resource management is involved THEN the system SHALL ensure proper resource lifecycle management
5. WHEN permissions are required THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control for Agent deployment
6. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide security warnings

### Requirement 7: Production-Ready Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want ActionLoom to be deployed with proper monitoring, scaling, and reliability features, so that it can serve thousands of users reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling for high user loads
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics, error rates, and user analytics
3. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL use MongoDB for workflows and Redis for caching with proper backup strategies
5. WHEN CI/CD is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically test and deploy updates safely
6. WHEN security is maintained THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication, authorization, and data encryption
