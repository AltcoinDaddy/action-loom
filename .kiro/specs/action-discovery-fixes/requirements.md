# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ActionLoom is experiencing critical runtime errors that prevent the application from functioning properly. The main issues are:

1. Action discovery service concurrency conflicts causing "Action discovery is already in progress" errors
2. React hydration failures due to server-client HTML mismatches
3. Flow API client errors (400 Bad Request) when discovering action registries
4. Multiple simultaneous action discovery requests causing race conditions

These issues need to be resolved to ensure the application runs smoothly and users can build workflows without encountering errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the action discovery service to handle concurrent requests properly, so that multiple components can request actions without causing conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple components request action discovery simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them sequentially
2. WHEN an action discovery is already in progress THEN subsequent requests SHALL wait for completion rather than throwing errors
3. WHEN action discovery completes THEN all waiting requests SHALL receive the cached results
4. IF action discovery fails THEN the system SHALL allow retry attempts without blocking future requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without hydration errors, so that I can use the workflow builder interface immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN server-rendered HTML SHALL match client-rendered HTML exactly
2. WHEN dynamic content is rendered THEN it SHALL be consistent between server and client
3. IF browser extensions modify the DOM THEN the application SHALL handle gracefully without breaking
4. WHEN fonts load THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or hydration mismatches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Flow API integration to work reliably, so that I can discover and use blockchain actions in my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system queries Flow API endpoints THEN requests SHALL be properly formatted and authenticated
2. WHEN Flow API returns errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate retry logic
3. WHEN action registries are discovered THEN the results SHALL be cached to prevent redundant API calls
4. IF Flow API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior or clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and users get meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
2. WHEN API requests fail THEN users SHALL see helpful error messages instead of console errors
3. WHEN concurrent operations conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts automatically
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN normal operation SHALL resume without requiring page refresh
