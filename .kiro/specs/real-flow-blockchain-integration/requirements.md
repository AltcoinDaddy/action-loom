# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ActionLoom currently operates with mock data and simulated blockchain interactions, preventing users from executing real workflows on the Flow blockchain. This feature will implement comprehensive Flow blockchain integration, including wallet connectivity, on-chain action discovery, real transaction execution, and production-ready blockchain operations. This transformation will make ActionLoom a fully functional blockchain automation platform capable of executing real DeFi strategies, NFT operations, and smart contract interactions.

The integration will leverage Flow's FCL (Flow Client Library), Access API, and on-chain registries to provide authentic blockchain functionality while maintaining the intuitive visual workflow builder interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Flow Wallet Integration

**User Story:** As a workflow builder user, I want to connect my Flow wallet to ActionLoom, so that I can execute real blockchain transactions and interact with my actual Flow account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Connect Wallet" THEN the system SHALL display available Flow wallet options (Blocto, Lilico, Dapper, Flow Wallet)
2. WHEN a user selects a wallet THEN the system SHALL initiate FCL authentication flow for that wallet provider
3. WHEN wallet connection is successful THEN the system SHALL display the connected account address and balance
4. WHEN a user is connected THEN the system SHALL persist the wallet session across browser refreshes
5. WHEN a user disconnects their wallet THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data and return to wallet-optional mode
6. WHEN wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options
7. WHEN multiple wallets are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to switch between connected wallets

### Requirement 2: Real-time Account Data Integration

**User Story:** As a connected user, I want to see my real Flow account data in ActionLoom, so that I can make informed decisions about workflow parameters and execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL fetch and display real FLOW token balance
2. WHEN viewing account data THEN the system SHALL show balances for all supported tokens (USDC, FUSD, etc.)
3. WHEN configuring parameters THEN the system SHALL validate against actual account balances
4. WHEN account data changes THEN the system SHALL update displayed information in real-time
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL cache account data and show last known state
6. WHEN fetching account data fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3: On-chain Action Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer or power user, I want ActionLoom to discover real Actions from Flow's on-chain registries, so that I can compose workflows using actual blockchain operations instead of mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL query Flow's Access API to discover available on-chain Actions
2. WHEN Actions are discovered THEN the system SHALL parse and validate Action metadata from smart contracts
3. WHEN Action registries are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the available Actions list
4. WHEN Actions have dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve and validate contract dependencies
5. WHEN Action discovery fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to curated Action list with clear indicators
6. WHEN Actions are incompatible with current network THEN the system SHALL filter them appropriately

### Requirement 4: Real Transaction Execution

**User Story:** As a workflow creator, I want to execute my workflows as real blockchain transactions, so that I can automate actual DeFi operations, NFT minting, and token transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Execute Workflow" THEN the system SHALL generate real Cadence transaction code
2. WHEN transaction is ready THEN the system SHALL display transaction preview with gas estimates and required authorizations
3. WHEN user confirms execution THEN the system SHALL submit the transaction to Flow blockchain via FCL
4. WHEN transaction is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide real transaction ID and status tracking
5. WHEN transaction is sealed THEN the system SHALL display execution results and any emitted events
6. WHEN transaction fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested fixes
7. WHEN multiple transactions are required THEN the system SHALL handle transaction sequencing and dependencies

### Requirement 5: Network and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between Flow testnet and mainnet environments, so that I can test workflows safely before executing them with real assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate current network (testnet/mainnet)
2. WHEN switching networks THEN the system SHALL update all blockchain connections and data sources
3. WHEN on testnet THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators and warnings
4. WHEN on mainnet THEN the system SHALL show additional confirmation dialogs for transaction execution
5. WHEN network switching fails THEN the system SHALL maintain current network and show error messages
6. WHEN Actions are network-specific THEN the system SHALL filter available Actions based on current network

### Requirement 6: Gas Estimation and Fee Management

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want accurate gas estimates and fee information before executing workflows, so that I can understand the cost implications of my blockchain operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN composing a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide real-time gas estimates for each Action
2. WHEN workflow is complex THEN the system SHALL calculate total estimated gas costs
3. WHEN gas prices change THEN the system SHALL update estimates automatically
4. WHEN account has insufficient FLOW for gas THEN the system SHALL prevent execution and show required amount
5. WHEN transaction execution begins THEN the system SHALL use current gas prices for accurate fee calculation
6. WHEN gas estimation fails THEN the system SHALL provide conservative estimates with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 7: Smart Contract Integration

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want ActionLoom to interact with real Flow smart contracts, so that I can access the full ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFT collections, and other on-chain applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN discovering Actions THEN the system SHALL identify and integrate with deployed Flow smart contracts
2. WHEN contracts have specific interfaces THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate Action metadata
3. WHEN contracts are updated THEN the system SHALL detect changes and update Action definitions
4. WHEN interacting with contracts THEN the system SHALL handle proper resource management and capabilities
5. WHEN contracts have access control THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions before execution
6. WHEN contract interactions fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and debugging help

### Requirement 8: Security and Risk Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want ActionLoom to protect me from malicious transactions and provide clear security warnings, so that I can use the platform safely with valuable assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing transactions THEN the system SHALL validate all transaction parameters against expected formats
2. WHEN high-value transactions are detected THEN the system SHALL require additional confirmation steps
3. WHEN suspicious patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL warn users and require explicit approval
4. WHEN interacting with unverified contracts THEN the system SHALL display clear security warnings
5. WHEN transaction simulation detects issues THEN the system SHALL prevent execution and explain the risks
6. WHEN user data is processed THEN the system SHALL never store private keys or sensitive wallet information

### Requirement 9: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want ActionLoom to perform reliably with fast response times, so that I can execute time-sensitive blockchain operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL connect to Flow network within 3 seconds
2. WHEN fetching account data THEN the system SHALL complete requests within 2 seconds under normal conditions
3. WHEN submitting transactions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate confirmation of submission
